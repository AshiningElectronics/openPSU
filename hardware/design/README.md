# Notes

* Designed using kicad version 2014-08-24 BZR 5093. Older versions (like 2013-ish) will open the schematic but could fail to load the kicad-pcb file.

* 3D models come from http://smisioto.no-ip.org/elettronica/kicad/kicad.htm

* BOM was chosen based on digikey stock, automatically generated by a kicad python script
