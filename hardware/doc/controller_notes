# Microcontroller

* Arduino: is a fairly cheap and popular platform, but I never used it. Also, the ADC for current measurment does not have enough resolution.
* MSP430: never used it
* EFM32: it has 12 bit ADC, single ended and differential mode supported. USB. Temperature sensor. Its quite a reasonable choice.
* STM32: Its overkill, so is the EFM32, but many people is familiar with these. Not sure if it has differential ADCs

# Wishlist

* Digipots
* 12 bit ADC for current shunt, supply output and transformer output
* 3x 7 segment digits for voltage and 3x for current
* display power (VxI)?
* USB?
* WIFI? (ESP8266) How to setup essid/keys?
* Datalogging
* Voltage control over tty/IP
